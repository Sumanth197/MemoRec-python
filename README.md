## Introduction
MemoRec is a novel approach that makes use of a collaborative filtering strategy to recommend valuable entities related to the model under construction. Original approach can provide suggestions related to both meta-classes and structured features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Download Dataset
To download the dataset required for the project, run the following command:

git clone -b memorec https://github.com/MDEGroup/MemoRec.git
The dataset can be found in the dataset directory:
MemoRec/dataset

## Fetch Code Files
Make sure to navigate to the directory where the code files are located. You can find the runner.py script inside the MemoRec directory.

## Running the Code
Once you have the dataset and fetched the code files, you can run the project using the following command:
```bash
python runner.py

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to MemoRec, please follow these steps:

Fork the project.
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
Make your changes and commit them (git commit -m 'Add some feature').
Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
Create a new Pull Request.
